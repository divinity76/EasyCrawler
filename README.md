# EasyCrawler
EasyCrawler is a web crawler for EasyList and EasyPrivacy.

I sincerely hope this project can be merged to https://github.com/easylist/easycrawler as I requested [here](https://github.com/easylist/easylist/issues/488).

# Philosophy
This project is established to help stop non-free JavaScripts, so [LibreJS](https://github.com/nikolas/LibreJS) don't have to consume CPU and memory resources to block them. However, most JavaScripts are non-free, and ads are not required. JavaScripts that are [released free](https://www.gnu.org/software/librejs/manual/html_node/Setting-Your-JavaScript-Free.html) should be white listed from a free software standpoint.

Most likely they never will become free software so I donated this project to EasyList so they can use it to block ads.

Also, EasyCrawler is targeted towards popular pornographic sites to help remove revenge pornography (the sexually explicit portrayal of one or more people that is distributed without their consent via any medium), and I also report these domains to pornographic blocking add-on on addons.mozilla.org.
