# EasyCrawler
EasyCrawler is a web crawler for EasyList and EasyPrivacy.

I sincerely hope this project can be merged to https://github.com/easylist/easycrawler as I requested [here](https://github.com/easylist/easylist/issues/488).

# Philosophy
This project is established to help stop non-free JavaScripts, so [LibreJS](https://github.com/nikolas/LibreJS) doesn't have to consume CPU and memory resources to block them. However, most JavaScripts are non-free, and ads are not required. JavaScripts that are [released free](https://www.gnu.org/software/librejs/manual/html_node/Setting-Your-JavaScript-Free.html) should be white listed from a free software standpoint.

Most likely they never will become free software so I donated this project to EasyList so they can use it to block ads.
